# SQL Data Analytics Project

A structured collection of SQL scripts focused on data exploration, analytics, and reporting use cases within a relational database environment.

This project demonstrates the application of SQL to analyze datasets, generate performance metrics, evaluate trends, and perform segmentation to support business decision-making.

## Project Scope

The analysis performed in this repository includes:

- Database exploration and schema understanding  
- Revenue and performance metric calculations  
- Time-based trend analysis  
- Cumulative and rolling metrics  
- Customer segmentation logic  
- Reporting-focused SQL queries  

Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and follows structured query design principles.

## Technical Implementation

The project applies the following SQL concepts:

- Aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)  
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses  
- Window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, cumulative calculations)  
- Subqueries and derived tables  
- CASE expressions for segmentation  
- Date functions for time-series analysis  

The queries are written to reflect practical business reporting scenarios commonly encountered in analytics roles.
